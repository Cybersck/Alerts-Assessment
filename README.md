#
# I have chosen to use the Model View Controller design pattern as I feel it best compliments reacts unidirectional data flow.
#
# The logical flow of the application is as follows:
# Components call on controllers -> controllers process data, dispatch actions, and call on services -> services contain API calls.
# Generally controllers will have functions corresponding to all applicable crud operations, make the call to a service inside of a promise, wait for a response
# and then dispatch to update state or handle errors. 
# (If requested I would be happy to add simulated api calls to demonstrate my knowledge of promises and async/await but for the sake of time contraints I'm submitting without for now)
# The 'Helpers' folder would normally contain other business logic or global functions that aren't component specific and do not directly affect state (not applicable to this project)
#

# This project has also been modified to use react-app-rewired for absolute paths (for cleaner, standardized imports)




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
